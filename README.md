- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rurik-Vaeringjar
- 👀 I’m interested in being the very best, like no one ever was.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more C/C++, more Python, GDScript, AI stuff, GLSL, the Vulkan API, and more assembly so I can understand bootloaders better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on secret government protects involving the stuff they found buried under the pyramids... and maybe like a video game or something.
- 📫 "How to reach me" is not how I would have started this line...
